Blacksburg Software Team ISD VT project for design, prototyping, and testing reports of a
web-based scrum board. Attached to this repository are project milestones 1-5.

The project/prototype, simply named "Web-Based Scrum Board," provides users wth a simple, easy to
understand interface online to create new scrum boards to help organize and manage tasks.
Tasks are held within columns, which can be assigned a priority number for organization within
a column. Columns can also be created and re-named to serve as scrum board categories.
